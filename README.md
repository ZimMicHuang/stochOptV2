# Liability Matching with Defaultable Securities: A Stochastic Dominance Approach

# Author: Ziming Huang, JC Borman, Nicolas Colonna, Aisha Koyas

# Abstract

We propose a new framework of the interest-rate-immunized liability matching problem in which de-
faultable securities and stochastic liability streams are present. Liability-matching refers to the problem

when an investor aims to cover predictable future payments by trading in credit or fixed income securities.
Interest-rate immunization aims at constructing a portfolio which is indifferent to small interest rate changes.
Immunization is achieved by imposing two constraints. The first one imposes a stochastic order relation in

which the random cash-flows are required to stochastically dominate the random stream of liability obliga-
tions. The second constraint requires equal interest-rate sensitivity (in expectation) of the cash-flow and

liability streams. We subsequently develop and analyze a method for numerical optimization method based

on the methods proposed in (Dentcheva and Ruszczy ́nski 2010). As a result, we compare our stochastic dom-
inance model with other models such as the standard ”no-default” model, a risk-neutral model (expectation),

and a risk-averse model (mean semi-deviation). Stress-testing shows that our stochastic dominance model
outperforms all aforementioned models in different interest-rate and credit market regimes.
